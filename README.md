Bejeweled has returned to Azeroth! A game made by PopCap Games, Inc.

Just download the zip and place the "Bejeweled" folder into the /Interface/AddOns/ folder.

Please use a bug reporting addon before opening issues.

Any help getting this addon working 100% is welcome.

### If anyone wishes to fork this, feel free. I'm on a long hiatus from WoW and updates will be sporadic. I'm currently unsure if there will be support for WoW Classic. ###
